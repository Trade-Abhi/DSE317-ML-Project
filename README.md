Navigating the rapidly evolving mobile phone market requires precise classification tools to predict
price ranges based on product features. Machine learning techniques are increasingly employed in
decision-making problems, including price prediction scenarios like mobile phones, where various clas-
sification algorithms are applied [1]. This analysis leverages a well-structured dataset with 2000
training instances and 1000 test instances, categorically divided into ’cheap’, ’moderate’, ’economical’,
and ’expensive’ price ranges. Each class is equally represented in the training data, eliminating the
need for complex data balancing techniques. The dataset boasts 20 descriptive features, including
battery power, Bluetooth availability, and clock speed, among others.
The robustness of the dataset is evident from the absence of missing values, facilitating a smooth
preprocessing phase. The task at hand is a clear-cut classification problem: assigning mobile phones
to one of four predefined price categories, distinct from predicting continuous values as in regression
problems.
This study extends the initial approach of employing traditional machine learning models like
Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), to more sophisticated techniques
such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees, examined in Phase I. Additionally, the potential
of neural networks to detect intricate data patterns is assessed.
Model performance is primarily gauged by accuracy, reflecting the proportion of correctly predicted
instances. However, a deeper dive into precision, recall, and F1-scores allows for a multifaceted eval-
uation, highlighting the models’ precision in class identification and their generalization capabilities.
This comprehensive analysis not only benchmarks our models against contemporary techniques but
also sets the stage for future advancements in predictive analytics within the mobile industry.
